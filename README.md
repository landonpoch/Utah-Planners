UtahPlanners is an old school project that I wrote while
attending Brigham Young University. The site was created
for a friend who was studying city planning. There are 
still feature requests for the site but development has
been stopped for a while due to the demands of current
employment. I decided to put this on github to get more
familiar with github and work on my programming skills.

I plan on converting the project over to a more DDD
approach.  I also plan on a general refactor to clean up
the code.  Other plans are to do a complete conversion
to MVC v3 or possibly v4.
