    <p>This site contains over 300 examples of attached housing 
        developments from Utah, Salt Lake and Davis counties in Utah. Individual 
        projects reflect the local character and range from suburban to urban, high to 
        low density, and decades old to newly built.
    </p>
 
    <p>I have also included additional information to bring out the specific character 
        of each project by detailing items such as exterior street type (local, 
        collector or arterial), quality of open space and number of businesses, parks 
        and churches located in the vicinity of the project.
    </p>
 
    <p>The site was designed from a city planner’s perspective, but would also be useful 
        to developers, realtors, and others. It is highly searchable by unit type, 
        density, locality and other characteristics so enjoy!
